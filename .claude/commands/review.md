# Code Review

Review the current code changes using confidence-based scoring.

## Step 1: Get Changes

Determine the scope of review:

- If $ARGUMENTS specifies files, review those files
- Otherwise, review unstaged changes: `git diff`
- If no unstaged changes, review staged changes: `git diff --cached`

## Step 2: Review

For each changed file, apply the code-review skill criteria:
- Project guidelines compliance (from CLAUDE.md)
- Bug detection (logic errors, security, performance)
- Code quality (duplication, complexity, test coverage)

## Step 3: Score and Filter

Rate each issue 0-100. Only report issues with confidence >= 75.

## Step 4: Output

Present findings in structured format with file paths, line numbers, and fix suggestions.
If no high-confidence issues, confirm code meets standards.
